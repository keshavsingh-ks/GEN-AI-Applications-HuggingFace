## Generative AI Project

This repository documents my journey through building various generative AI applications, starting from image captioning with BLIP to building a sophisticated chatbot using LLaMA-7B with LangChain and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This README file will guide you through understanding the key elements of the project, how to run it, and what you can expect from it.

## Project Overview

This project comprises different stages of generative AI model development:

Image Captioning with BLIP: Bootstrapped Language Image Pre-training (BLIP) was used to generate context-rich image captions, providing a robust foundation for understanding image-language interactions.

Chatbot with OpenAI API: A chatbot was created using OpenAI models to gain insights into conversational AI. It helped me understand the intricacies of large language models in generating human-like responses.

Advanced Chatbot Using LLaMA-7B-Instruct and LangChain: Leveraged LLaMA-7B-Instruct with LangChain and implemented Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to build a more advanced, information-aware chatbot.

User Interface for Interaction: Built a simple yet effective UI using HTML/CSS/JavaScript to facilitate user interactions with the chatbot, with a backend hosted on Flask.

## Features

Image Captioning: Generate rich captions for images using the BLIP model.

Conversational Chatbot: Chatbot powered by LLaMA-7B and OpenAI for real-time conversational capabilities.

Information Retrieval with RAG: Enhanced chatbot responses with relevant and targeted data retrieval.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean web-based UI for easy interaction with the chatbot.

## Tech Stack

Python: Model integration and backend services.

BLIP: For advanced image captioning.

OpenAI API: Utilized for the initial chatbot development.

LLaMA-7B-Instruct & LangChain: For building a highly interactive chatbot.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Boosted the information retrieval capabilities.

Flask: For hosting the API.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For building a web interface.
